# Proposal
Final Proposal &amp; Final for Programming for Digital Arts Course.

## Python Planner
Many people, including myself, struggle to remember due dates, deadlines, and important dates in general. This problem not only applies to those in the field of tech arts, but also to most jobs in general, where deadlines are commonly given. 

While not entirely a solution and more so a tool to remember important dates, I, for my final, will make a planner in python that will create a formatted text file (.txt) that shows important dates inputted by the user along with dates (months and/or day of a month), specific times, and additional notes. The program will then save a .txt file with the information inputted in a readable, chronologically formatted order.

## Challenges
While I should have the necessary coding knowledge to make this program, I will more than likely have to learn how to properly format a schedule planner, such as this.

## Outcomes
The ideal outcome for this program would be for the program to produce a calendar like schedule, with months, years, specific times, a description of the important dates inputted, and additional notes for each, in chronological. A minimal outcome would show at least a readable list of important dates to the user, even if they aren't chronological.

## Milestones
- Implement main function. User input section.
- Implement .txt file creating function.
- Implement write function. 
- Implement formatting function.
- Implement save function.
- Complete program.
