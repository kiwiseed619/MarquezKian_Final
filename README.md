# Python Planner
Many people, including myself, struggle to remember due dates, deadlines, and important dates in general. This problem not only applies to those in the field of tech arts, but also to most jobs in general, where deadlines are commonly given. 

While not entirely a solution and more so a tool to remember important dates, I, for my final, will make a planner in python that will create a formatted text file (.txt) that shows important dates inputted by the user along with dates (months and/or day of a month) and specific times. The user will also be able to input additional notes regarding specific deadlines/important dates.
